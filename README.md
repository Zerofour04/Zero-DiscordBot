## ℹ️Description
> Hey, I developed a Discord bot using some raw data because so many people have the same problems.

> Of course, everything is open source, I don't expect anything and I also run a wiki/tutorials on how to integrate some features into the bot, but I would be happy if you give this repository a star and share it.
